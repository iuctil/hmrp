# About HMRP (2. Introduction)

The 2018-2023 Strategic Plan, Greatness Through Innovation, continues the transformational journey of Pathways to Greatness begun in 2012-2018. The performance goals identified for 2023 will keep UVI on course to emerge beyond the limits of its expanding ability. The growth attained under the last strategic initiatives demonstrated the University’s remarkable capacity for achieving lofty aspirations that may appear out of reach when compared to existing resources.

Greatness Through Innovation was framed through the window of the 2016-2017 Self-Study process. Like Pathways to Greatness, Greatness Through Innovation is an initiative with an ambitious target. The University’s ability to forge ahead in the face of numerous challenges is evidence of its persistent/persevering capacity for staying the course. The 2018 accomplishments have been assimilated and refined in the new strategic plan.

The Self-Study achieved major strides in steering components to employ measures that successfully demonstrate accomplishments. The new strategic plan strengthens that direction, giving the Institution opportunities for increasing effectiveness in evidence-based decision-making. Data collection and data management are threads that run throughout the Greatness Through Innovation performance requirements.

There is no doubt that creativity and innovation will be the hallmarks for achieving success in strategic plan 2023. Focus area I: Innovation and Distinction, leverages the persistence and ingenuity of the workforce for restoring and rebuilding in the face of several gruesome natural disasters. The goals ensure that UVI will see creativity as a natural element for accomplishing objectives throughout the operational programs. Through the establishment and maintenance of an Innovation Fund, targeted creativity training, and expansion of innovation resources, the pockets of creativity that now distinguish some programs can become the established culture for the entire Institution.

Focus Area II: Leadership and Excellence in Academics, Research, and Public Services, emphasizes the understanding that the strength of the academy lies in the power of its curriculum and faculty. The strategic initiatives speak to the infusion of technology throughout the academic programs, ensuring that success levels may be broadly achieved. Through the operational objectives, renowned research areas in Science and Mathematics, Nursing, and Business may increase levels of visibility for their distinctive programming, and inspire similar achievements throughout the Institution and abroad.

UVI places the well-being of students at the head of its core values. Focus Area III: Student Access, Recruitment, and Success brings together the second largest pool of financial resources (after physical plant disaster repair) for addressing known impediments to student success. Strategic initiatives identify tuition support options, creative degree pathways and instructional pedagogy, and holistic approaches for attractive living-learning experiences.

The major achievement of the 2016-2017 Self-Study comes together in Focus Area IV: Measurement, Analysis, Knowledge Management, and Results. This area is key for demonstrating continuous improvement through systematic data collection and data management. It is here that efforts of UVINext may become fully-implemented, achieving its charge to drive the overall institution towards a culture of evidence-based decision-making. From improvements in student recruitment through graduation and employee performance assessments, UVI will be demonstrating its commitment to collecting evidence that clearly shows the impact and success of actions taken in academic and community programs.

Focus Area V: Operational Efficiencies and Focus, emphasizes functional accuracy and best practices in business operations. Strategic initiatives will address gaps in effective documentation of protocols and processes. This includes aligning workflows to reduce costs, errors, and inefficiencies; understanding and valuing consistent, high quality customer service; and systematically repairing and maintaining damaged facilities for structural improvements. The focus area recognizes the critical importance of effective budgeting functions for achieving the goals of the strategic plan, and gives attention to the important role of the University Budget Committee (UBC) in effectively managing resources to achieve the related objectives.

Focus Area VI: Valuing People, Relationships, and Culture clarifies and institutionalizes UVI’s systems for personal development and employee incentives. The shared-governance model addresses the mechanism for giving voice to UVI stakeholders in major policy development, and key operational decisions. Greatness Through Innovation fills the gap for celebrating the UVI population’s diversity, skill, and accomplishments. Strategic initiatives include opportunities for community engagement and intermingling, celebration of regional culture and history, and mechanisms for reward and salary enhancements.

As a uniquely American, English-speaking institution within the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean, UVI’s role as a producer/venue of thought leaders is critically important to the US Virgin Islands, the wider Caribbean, and the World. The impact of two devastating storms throughout the territory during the 2017 hurricane season, has created opportunities for the University’s informed leadership to add even greater value. Attesting to the adage of “that which does not kill you makes you stronger,” UVI’s strength demonstrated throughout the recovery and rebuilding process is evidence that the university IS stronger than it was during the last decennial self-study. In recovery, the institution marshalled its collective innovative and creative energy, to achieve goals that were seemingly impossible in the face of widespread devastation. As the territory embarks on the rebuilding process, UVI is well-placed to model these unique solutions, and to provide data and insight on the deployment of technology and services for communities to weather future natural or other disasters effectively.

## Plan Approach (3. Why HMP?)

Natural disasters are deadly and costly. They destroy our physical and economic heath, and reverse any progress we have made. They set us back and dramatically alter our reality into something we never wanted or do not recognize. Disasters also act as mirrors. They show our strengths and bring out the best in us, but they also magnify our physical and social fault lines, and force us to recognize our deficiencies.

Over the past 40 years, the Virgin Islands has experienced a high level of development, and, for a few years, things were going well. However, together we have experienced four major hurricanes, a myriad of storms, floods, and droughts. We are currently experiencing another economic crisis (the third since 2008-09), this one caused by a pandemic. We have emerged from the disruptions; Virgin Islanders are strong and resilient people who help and care for each other. But the fact remains that after each of these events, our population decreased, and our economy shrank. Disasters have repeatedly set us back and changed us. 

Unfortunately, things are likely to get worse. Climate change is amplifying the strength and frequency of some hazards, and the intensity of their physical and economic impacts. The question of how we prevent these hazards from becoming outright disasters for the health and well-being of the people of the Virgin Islands is becoming more urgent.

We know that we cannot fully predict future shocks and surprises. But we have the power to build a more complete understanding of the socio-economic and natural dynamics of our islands, and develop strategies that will transform potential disasters into mere disturbances. To do this, we must take stock of how we are doing as a territory today, and address our chronic and acute vulnerabilities. We can do this by improving the robustness of our infrastructure and upgrade some of our operation and maintenance processes, and by protecting our natural resources. We can also do this by monitoring our constantly evolving infrastructure systems, and by developing skills that will allow us to anticipate and adapt to unexpected events. Lastly, we need to recognize that comprehensive risk reduction is a collective effort, and work with non-governmental organizations and community partners.  In other words, by understanding how we are doing today, and with the proper mitigation and resilience strategies, we can reduce risk and ensure we always have access to what we need to thrive.

The Hazard Mitigation and Resilience Plan (HMRP) is creating a framework for comprehensive disaster risk reduction in the USVI. The HMRP seeks to understand how things are going in the Territory, and asks the question of whether we have the resources and capacities necessary to handle the impacts of future hurricanes, earthquakes, drought, increase in sea-level or rise in temperatures. The plan evaluates our strengths and our weaknesses, and identifies where and how we can invest in risk management and reduction initiatives. The plan also looks at where we can foster practices and processes that allow us to anticipate issues and adapt during events that sneak in on us. Finally, the plan evaluates how expected major shifts in our development pathways can impact social and natural systems, and imagines ways in which our territory can positively transform itself in the face of anticipated future developments.

This plan will not be successful without your participation. Please visit resilientvi.com and register to join us at our upcoming workshop on November 5th and 6th to learn how we are doing, and to discuss how we can sustain long-term risk reduction strategies. And how we can prepare for tomorrow…today.

## Plan Navigation (4. How to Navigate this Report - for FEMA and VITEMA officials)

This project was originally conceived of by Michael Byrne, the former federal coordinating officer and federal disaster-recovery coordinator for Puerto Rico and the USVI, who approached then–USVI governor Kenneth Mapp in late 2018 to offer the same kind of analytical support from the Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center (HSOAC) that FEMA had offered Puerto Rico. HSOAC had coordinated the writing of Puerto Rico’s recovery plan that was submitted to the U.S. Congress in August 2018 (Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resiliency, 2018). Governor Bryan, working through the USVI Office of Disaster Recovery (ODR), agreed that there was value in updating the territory’s recovery plans through analytical support from HSOAC.

Per the guidance provided by FEMA and the USVI government, one of the main goals of this effort was to provide an overarching and consolidated overview of how recovery is progressing in the USVI, informed by feedback from a diverse group of stakeholders. In particular, FEMA asked us to (1) update the USVI government and its federal partners on the progress that has been made to date, (2) analyze the challenges and barriers that have delayed progress, and (3) make actionable recommendations to improve the efficiency of recovery processes. Future steps that prioritize and phase these recommendations will be important for recovery.

This report builds on the strong foundation the USVI government laid with its previous recovery planning documents (Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, 2018; USVI Hurricane Recovery and Resilience Task Force, 2018; Witt O’Brien’s USVI and Strategy Group Virgin Islands, 2019), which were developed after the 2017 hurricanes and presented a long-term vision for recovery and development. It provides an assessment of the current state of recovery progress in the USVI in the key sectors damaged by the hurricanes; synthesizes the general vision or directions for recovery in each sector; identifies the main challenges or barriers to recovery in each sector, including the sources of delays in recovery processes; and makes actionable recommendations to address the issues identified and accelerate the recovery process overall. As part of this effort, HSOAC research staff held more than 170 discussions with stakeholders (each involving multiple people) across the USVI and derived 76 key recommendations, organized by sector, that can help the USVI enhance its recovery efforts.

The recommendations in this report were developed through a bottom-up process that involved the aforementioned discussions with hundreds of stakeholders in the USVI government, its federal partners, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations. This report presents some recommendations that are new, some that are currently being considered, and some that are being implemented. We believe that there is considerable value in presenting them as a cohesive and comprehensive plan that ties them directly to the main challenges facing the USVI. Additionally, each recommendation includes a series of key steps to take to ensure that that the policy actions being considered or taken are ultimately successful. We offer these in the spirit of adaptive management(Wise, 2006), recognizing that leaders face urgent needs and must make decisions and that plans and strategies can and should be regularly updated throughout the recovery process. We also recognize that some recommendations—particularly those related to FEMA’s financing procedures—would require policy or statutory changes that are unlikely to take place in time to affect the USVI’s recovery. Figure 1.1 shows the report’s organization. It begins with chapters that analyze four overarching, crosscutting capacities: management, fiscal, workforce, and supply chain. It then moves on to chapters that focus on infrastructure (infrastructure services,energy, housing, and natural and cultural resources [NCR]), followed by the economy and public services (tourism economy, education, and health). These topics were identified in collaboration with the USVI territory government and FEMA at the beginning of the project.

This report differs from the previous recovery plans developed for the USVI, in part because of its focus on the USVI’s overall capacity to implement recovery,the recovery needs in specific sectors, and implementation considerations. It highlights the important role that capacity—related to government management, fiscal, workforce, and supply-chain issues—will play in determining how well and how quickly the USVI’s recovery succeeds. It highlights areas of strength for the USVI government’s capacity and areas that will likely need to be enhanced, either through internal USVI government measures or through the provision of assistance from federal partners or other interested parties.

Finally, the analysis presented in this report shows that many of the capacity recommendations are foundational to the USVI government’s ability to implement recovery projects across all sectors of its economy. These recommendations are “prerequisites” in that, if the challenges they are designed to overcome are not addressed, the USVI’s overall recovery likely will continue to be significantly delayed. In the remainder of this introduction, we provide a brief overview of the USVI, the damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria,and recovery activities to date. We then discuss recovery directions and timelines, summarize the methods used in this project, and provide a map for the rest of the report.
